👋 Hey there! I'm Daniel Odukwe, but you can call me Vader – yes, the force is strong with me, and I'm a passionate Star Wars fan. 🌌 When I'm not immersed in coding or conquering virtual realms in games, you'll find me lost in the enchanting world of mythological books, exploring tales from various cultures.

🥇 I've got a degree in Computer Science, and my journey into coding has been quite an adventure. Right now, I'm on an exciting path exploring Full Stack Development. I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the fascinating world of React. 

### what am i up to ?
I'm currently immersing myself in the world of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My focus is on mastering Node.js and integrating it seamlessly with the Express framework. 🌐
Learning is a continuous process, and as I explore the ever-evolving tech landscape, I'm committed to discovering new things while staying true to my coding journey.
